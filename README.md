# Casino Heist
**We’re an open-source blockchain playground offering challenges that feature not only the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in smart contracts and their mitigations but also other common vulnerabilities and simplified versions of real-world hacks.**

Are you a blockchain developer, auditor, enthusiast, or just starting your journey into the world of blockchain?

**You’re in the right place!** 

The Web3 and blockchain space has grown significantly over the past few years, with many real-world applications of blockchain in areas like finance, voting, and gaming. Advanced technology doesn’t come without security risks. Whether you're looking to gain new skills (such as smart contract security) or explore a career as a smart contract developer or auditor, mastering and understanding security is essential to protecting the ecosystem we're building.

Casino Heist is designed as a playground where you can not only learn about vulnerabilities but also try to exploit them yourself.

## Main Feature
- **Private Blockchain**  
    We use [paradigmCTF](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/paradigm-ctf-infrastructure) infrastructure that is further customized by [TCP1P community](https://github.com/TCP1P/Paradigmctf-BlockChain-Infra-Extended) to make it look better and to run a private blockchain.
- **Seamless Onboarding**  
    Player doesn't need to setup any wallet for getting Ethers from faucet, making new users that aren't familiar with the setup can play without dealing with those complexities.
- **Playground Experience**  
    Because smart contract hacks can lead to financial losses, we thought the *Casino Heist* theme would be a perfect match for our content.
- **Self-Paced and Guided**  
    Got stuck on a problem? We got you! We provide you with hints and even the walkthrough of the `common` category challenges
- **Real-Life Incident Simplified**  
    We’re not here for just the basics. With our VIP category, everyone gets access to real-life hacks that we’ve simplified, which make anyone can feel the thrill of real-world scenarios.
